/**
 * This class handles sequences of replacements resulting from a comparison.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The comparison of two objects sequences leads to the identification of common
 * parts and parts which only belong to the first or to the second sequence. The
 * common parts appear in the edit script in the form of &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; commands,
 * they can be considered as synchronization objects between the two sequences.
 * These synchronization objects split the two sequences in synchronized
 * sub-sequences. The first sequence can be transformed into the second one by
 * replacing each synchronized sub-sequence of the first sequence by the
 * corresponding sub-sequence of the second sequence. This is a synthetic way to
 * see an {@link EditScript edit script}, replacing individual
 * {@link DeleteCommand delete}, {@link KeepCommand keep} and
 * {@link InsertCommand insert} commands by fewer replacements acting on
 * complete sub-sequences.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is devoted to perform this interpretation. It visits an
 * {@link EditScript edit script} (because it implements the
 * {@link CommandVisitor CommandVisitor} interface) and calls a user-supplied
 * handler implementing the {@link ReplacementsHandler ReplacementsHandler}
 * interface to process the sub-sequences.
 *
 * @see ReplacementsHandler
 * @see EditScript
 * @see SequencesComparator
