/**
 * Abstract base class for all commands used to transform an objects sequence
 * into another one.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When two objects sequences are compared through the
 * {@link SequencesComparator#getScript SequencesComparator.getScript} method,
 * the result is provided has a {@link EditScript script} containing the commands
 * that progressively transform the first sequence into the second one.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are only three types of commands, all of which are subclasses of this
 * abstract class. Each command is associated with one object belonging to at
 * least one of the sequences. These commands are {@link InsertCommand
 * InsertCommand} which correspond to an object of the second sequence being
 * inserted into the first sequence, {@link DeleteCommand DeleteCommand} which
 * correspond to an object of the first sequence being removed and
 * {@link KeepCommand KeepCommand} which correspond to an object of the first
 * sequence which &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; an object in the second sequence. It is
 * guaranteed that comparison is always performed this way (i.e. the
 * &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method of the object from the first sequence is used and
 * the object passed as an argument comes from the second sequence) ; this can
 * be important if subclassing is used for some elements in the first sequence
 * and the &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method is specialized.
